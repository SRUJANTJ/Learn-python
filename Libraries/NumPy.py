# Why numpy
# Machine Learning deals with large datasets and mathematical computations (like matrix multiplication, dot products, etc.).

# Pythonâ€™s built-in lists are slow because they:

# Store elements as generic Python objects (not optimized for numbers).

# Lack built-in vectorized math operations.

# NumPy solves this by:

# Storing data in contiguous memory blocks (fast access).

# Using C/Fortran-optimized backend for computation.

# Allowing vectorized operations (no slow Python loops).
