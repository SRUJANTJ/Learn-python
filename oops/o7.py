# Access Modifiers
# Access modifiers in Python control the visibility of class members (attributes and methods). They help encapsulate data, allowing for better control over how an object's data is accessed and modified. Python primarily uses three types of access modifiers:

# Default Access: By default, all members in Python are public unless specified otherwise.

# Public
# Public members are accessible from outside the class. They can be accessed and modified freely. By default, all members in Python are public unless specified otherwise.


class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand  # Public attribute
        self.model = model  # Public attribute

    def display_info(self):
        return f"Car: {self.brand} {self.model}"

# Creating an object of the Car class
my_car = Car("Toyota", "Camry")
print(my_car.display_info())  # Output: Car: Toyota Camry
print(my_car.brand)           # Output: Toyota



# Protected
# Protected members are indicated by a single underscore prefix (_). They are intended to be accessed only within the class and by derived classes (subclasses). They should not be accessed directly from outside the class, although they can still be accessed if necessary (itâ€™s more of a convention).

class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self._name = name  # Protected attribute

    def _make_sound(self):  # Protected method
        return "Some sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def bark(self):
        return f"{self._name} says Woof!"

# Creating an object of the Dog class
my_dog = Dog("Buddy")
print(my_dog.bark())  # Output: Buddy says Woof!
print(my_dog._make_sound())  # Output: Some sound (not recommended)








# Private
# Private members are indicated by a double underscore prefix (__). They are intended to be inaccessible from outside the class. Python uses name mangling to make it harder to access private attributes from outside the class.

class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance=0):
        self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            self.__balance += amount

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if 0 < amount <= self.__balance:
            self.__balance -= amount

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance

account = BankAccount()
account.deposit(100)
print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 100
# print(account.__balance)  # AttributeError: 'BankAccount' object has no attribute '__balance'





# Summary of Access Modifiers
# Public: Accessible from anywhere (default).

# Protected: Intended for use within the class and subclasses (conventionally accessible but not recommended from outside).

# Private: Not accessible from outside the class (name mangling used).
