# For loop examples

# Example 1: Iterating over a list
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)  # This will print each fruit in the list

# Example 2: Iterating over a string
for letter in 'hello':
    print(letter)  # This will print each letter in the string

# Example 3: Using range() function
for number in range(5):
    print(number)  # This will print numbers from 0 to 4





    # While loop example
    #declaring the variable
count=0
while count < 5:
 print(f"while loop count: {count}")
 count += 1
